# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Page View Duration Statistics feature aims to provide users with detailed insights into their browsing behavior by tracking and analyzing the time spent on individual web pages. This feature will help users understand their browsing habits better, identify which content they spend the most time on, and potentially improve their productivity by highlighting time-consuming websites.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track how much time I spend on each webpage, so that I can understand my browsing habits better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a webpage THEN the system SHALL start tracking the time spent on that page.
2. WHEN a user switches tabs, minimizes the browser, or locks their screen THEN the system SHALL pause the time tracking.
3. WHEN a user returns to a previously visited page THEN the system SHALL resume time tracking and accumulate the total time spent.
4. WHEN a user navigates away from a page or closes the tab THEN the system SHALL record the session duration.
5. WHEN tracking time on a page THEN the system SHALL normalize URLs to avoid counting the same content with different query parameters as separate pages.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view statistics about my page viewing duration, so that I can analyze my browsing patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display a summary of the most time-consuming pages for the current day.
2. WHEN a user views the detailed statistics page THEN the system SHALL show a list of all tracked pages sorted by total time spent.
3. WHEN displaying page statistics THEN the system SHALL show the page title, URL, favicon, and total time spent in a human-readable format.
4. WHEN a user selects a specific date range THEN the system SHALL filter and display page statistics for that period.
5. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL provide visual representations (charts) of time distribution across different pages.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage and control my browsing data, so that I can maintain my privacy and focus on relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to exclude certain domains from tracking THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add domains to an exclusion list.
2. WHEN a user wants to delete browsing data for a specific page THEN the system SHALL provide a way to remove that data.
3. WHEN a user wants to clear all tracking data THEN the system SHALL provide an option to delete all stored page view durations.
4. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL keep all information locally on the user's device and not transmit it to any external servers.
5. WHEN tracking is disabled in the extension settings THEN the system SHALL not collect any page view duration data.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tracking to be accurate and lightweight, so that it doesn't affect my browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking page view durations THEN the system SHALL consume minimal CPU and memory resources.
2. WHEN a user is inactive on a page (no mouse or keyboard activity for a configurable period) THEN the system SHALL have an option to pause tracking.
3. WHEN tracking time THEN the system SHALL handle browser events like tab focus changes, visibility changes, and page navigation correctly.
4. WHEN a user is browsing in incognito mode THEN the system SHALL respect the user's privacy settings for data collection.
5. WHEN tracking time on single-page applications THEN the system SHALL correctly detect route changes and track them as separate pages.
